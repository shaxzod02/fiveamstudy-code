//Exercise 1.10:
// Find a web site that produces a large amount of data.
// Investigate caching by running fetchall twice in succession to see whether the reported time changes much.
// Do you get the same content each time? Modify fetchall to print its output to a file so it can be examined.

//Exercise 1.11:
// Try fetchall with longer argument lists, such as samples from the top million web sites
// available at alexa.com. How does the program behave if a web site just doesnâ€™t respond?
// (Section 8.9 describes mechanisms for coping in such cases.)

// The main function creates a channel of strings using make.
// For each command-line argument, the go statement in the first range loop starts a new goroutine
// that calls fetch asynchronously to fetch the URL using http.Get.
// The io.Copy function reads the body of the response and discards it by
// writing to the ioutil.Discard output stream. Copy returns the byte count,
// along with any error that occurred. As each result arrives, fetch sends a summary line on the channel ch.
// The second range loop in main receives and prints those lines.
